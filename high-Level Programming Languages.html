 <h2> high-Level Programming Languages </h2>
 <p> 
    A high-level language is a programming language designed to simplify computer programming. It is "high-level" since it is several steps removed from the actual code run on a computer's processor. High-level source code contains easy-to-read syntax that is later converted into a low-level language, which can be recognized and run by a specific CPU.

    Most common programming languages are considered high-level languages.

<h2> Advantages</h2>
<ol>
   <li>  Easier to modify as it uses English like statements</li>
   <li>Easier/faster to write code as it uses English like statements</li>
    <li> Easier to debug during development due to English like statements </li>
        <li> Portable code â€“ not designed to run on just one type of machine </li> 
</ol>
<p> As technology develops, the increase in the familiarity level of the programming languages also goes up drastically.

   <p>
     The list of programming languages that are in demand keeps changing depending on their usage, the number of performers/developers in that field and the continuous changes in that field.
