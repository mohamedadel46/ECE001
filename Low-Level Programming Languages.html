<h2>Low-Level Programming Languages </h2>
      <p> 
    A low-level language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction of programming concepts and is very close to writing actual machine instructions. Two examples of low-level languages are assembly and machine code.
</p>

<h2>Uses and other information </h2>
<p> 
    Low-level languages are useful because programs written in them can be crafted to run very fast and with a very minimal memory footprint. However, they are considered harder to utilize because they require a deeper knowledge of machine language.

    Low-level languages can convert to machine code without a compiler or interpreter – second-generation programming languages use a simpler processor called an assembler – and the resulting code runs directly on the processor. A program written in a low-level language can be made to run very quickly, with a small memory footprint. An equivalent program in a high-level language can be less efficient and use more memory. Low-level languages are simple, but considered difficult to use, due to numerous technical details that the programmer must remember. By comparison, a high-level programming language isolates execution semantics of a computer architecture from the specification of the program, which simplifies development.
</p>
<p> 
    Software programs and scripts are written in high-level languages, like C#, Swift, and PHP. A software developer can create and edit source code in a high-level language using a programming IDE or even a basic text editor. However, the code is not recognized directly by the CPU. Instead, it must be compiled into a low-level language.
</p> 
<p> 
Assembly language is one step closer to a high-level language than machine language. It includes commands such as MOV (move), ADD (add), and SUB (subtract). These commands perform basic operations, such as moving values into memory registers and performing calculations. Assembly language can be converted to the machine language using an assembler.
